# Drunkard-s-Walk-non-self-avoiding- 
This program studies the Drunkard's Walk problem, which focuses on the relationship between 
the number of steps in a simulation and the displacement from the origin. Steps can either be
up, down, left, or right, all with an equal random chance of occuring. This program represents
the simple version of this problem, as self-avoidance of the moving object's pathway is not 
considered here.
